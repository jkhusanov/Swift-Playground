# Swift Playground

This repo contains all of my small apps that I've created while taking iOS apps development course at college and other online non-credit courses like [Stanford University's CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/).
Playground for experiments and learning.
